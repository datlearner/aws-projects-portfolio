# AWS Projects Portfolio

This repository is a curated collection of **hands-on AWS projects** that demonstrate core cloud concepts and real-world architectures.  
The projects cover networking, compute, storage, monitoring, and serverless solutions, providing both learning resources and a professional showcase of AWS skills.  

Each project includes:
- **Architecture diagrams**  
- **Step-by-step implementation guides**  
- **Validation & testing results**  
- **VPC Flow Logs, monitoring, and security analysis**  

These labs are designed to align with **AWS certification paths** (Cloud Practitioner, Solutions Architect Associate) and to serve as a portfolio for aspiring **Cloud Architects and DevOps Engineers**.
